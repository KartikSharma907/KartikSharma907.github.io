# Wake-up Word Detection: Building a Speech Recognition Model

In July 2021, I worked on an independent project to build a wake-up word detection system. This project involved constructing a speech dataset from synthesized data and implementing a trigger word detection model with over 90% accuracy.

## Project Overview

The goal was to train a model to detect when someone has finished saying the word "activate". This type of system is commonly used in voice assistants like "Hey Siri" or "OK Google".

## Technical Implementation

I used a **GRU (Gated Recurrent Units)** architecture for this project. GRUs are particularly well-suited for sequential data like audio because they can maintain memory of previous inputs while being computationally efficient.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Construction**: Created a speech dataset from synthesized data
- **Model Architecture**: Implemented using GRU layers
- **Accuracy**: Achieved over 90% detection accuracy
- **Real-time Processing**: Model can process audio streams in real-time

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges was creating a robust dataset that could handle various accents, speaking speeds, and background noise. I addressed this by:

1. **Data Augmentation**: Synthesizing variations of the target word
2. **Noise Injection**: Adding background noise to improve robustness
3. **Speed Variations**: Including different speaking speeds in training data

## Results

The final model achieved:
- **Detection Accuracy**: >90%
- **False Positive Rate**: <5%
- **Response Time**: <100ms

## Future Improvements

Some potential enhancements for this project include:
- Support for multiple wake-up words
- Better noise robustness
- Integration with edge devices
- Multi-language support

This project gave me valuable experience in audio processing, deep learning for sequential data, and building practical machine learning applications.
